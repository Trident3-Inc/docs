# Welcome

This is to serve as an early documentation of T3id, how it works, and the SDK we provide.

## How it Works

T3id is a decentralized identity system that leverages NFTs to represent digital identities. Each T3id is a unique NFT associated with a human-readable @name, such as @alice, which serves as an identifier. This system is designed to provide a secure, verifiable, and flexible identity solution that can be used across various applications and platforms.

### Core Components

**Identity (T3id NFT)**
- Represents a digital identity as a unique NFT.
- Associated with a human-readable @name (1-32 characters, alphanumeric).
- Can hold multiple certificates, each representing a public key and associated metadata.
- Maintains an identity score based on valid certificates, which can be used to assess the trustworthiness and completeness of the identity.

**Certificates**
- Public keys stored on-chain with metadata, serving as verifiable credentials.
- Used for signing, encryption, and verification, enabling secure interactions and transactions.
- Includes:
  - Public key: The cryptographic key used for verification.
  - Category: Defines the type of certificate (e.g., 'SSO', 'KYC', 'FACE').
  - Issuer address: The blockchain address of the entity that issued the certificate.
  - Issuance and expiration dates: Define the validity period of the certificate.
  - Additional metadata URI: Links to off-chain data for extended information.

**Scoring System**
- Each certificate category has base and minimum scores, reflecting its importance and trust level.
- Scores decay linearly from issuance to expiration, ensuring that outdated certificates do not unduly influence the identity score.
- Total identity score is derived from valid certificates, providing a quantitative measure of identity strength.
- Categories include KYC (40/15), FACE (25/5), etc., each contributing differently to the overall score.

### Key Operations

**Minting a T3id**
- Creates a new T3id NFT with a unique @name, which serves as a permanent identifier for the user. This process involves generating a new NFT and associating it with the chosen @name, ensuring that the name is unique and adheres to the format requirements.

**Adding Certificates**
- Adds a new certificate to a T3id from an approved issuer. This operation involves verifying the issuer's approval status, generating a unique certificate ID, and storing the certificate data on-chain. Certificates enhance the T3id's functionality by enabling cryptographic operations and contributing to the identity score.

**Cross-chain Verification**
- Verifies T3id certificates across chains via LayerZero, a protocol that facilitates cross-chain communication. This feature allows T3id to be used in multi-chain environments, expanding its applicability and ensuring that identity verification is consistent across different blockchain networks.

### Architecture

The system consists of four main contracts:
- **T3idImplementation**: Handles core NFT and certificate logic, including minting, certificate management, and cross-chain verification.
- **T3idProxy**: Implements the upgradeable proxy pattern, allowing for seamless contract upgrades without disrupting existing data and functionality.
- **T3idRegistry**: Manages issuers and categories, ensuring that only approved entities can issue certificates and that categories are properly configured.
- **T3idStorage**: Stores certificates and scoring data, providing efficient access and management of identity-related information.

### Categories and Issuers

T3id supports a tiered system of certificate categories and issuer approvals, ensuring that certificates are issued by trusted entities and that their impact on the identity score is appropriately weighted.

**Primary**
- Includes high-trust categories such as government-issued IDs and KYC.
- Issuers must be approved by T3id administrators, ensuring a high level of trust and security.
- Certificates in this category contribute significantly to the identity score, reflecting their importance in verifying identity.

**Verified**
- Consists of trusted partners of Trident3, who have been vetted and approved to issue certificates.
- Requires issuer approval but is less stringent than Primary, allowing for a broader range of trusted entities.
- Used for partner-specific verifications and services, enhancing the flexibility and applicability of T3id.

**Other**
- Open to all issuers without the need for prior approval, enabling a wide range of use cases and applications.
- Includes general-purpose certificates with minimal impact on the identity score, suitable for less critical verifications.
